# Starting the domain

Go to the `src/domains/` folder and create a folder to represent the domain of the entity we are going to work with. The `Category`entity in the modeling that we are going to use for this tutorial will be allocated in the `General`namespace. The name of the created folder will be `General/` and inside it another one called `Category/`. So, at the end of this step, we will have a directory created in `src/domains/General/Category` that will be ready to receive the artifacts that we will see below.

A detailed description of the domains can be found [here](../como-utilizar/domain.md).

Note that we can use any name that makes sense for the resource we are working on, the domain thinking exercise helps to distribute the application's resources
