  This brief tutorial is intended to present a concept in building interfaces
  using Vue.js and Quasar, but the most important here is the methodology
  applied and not the project itself

# Next steps

Everything we saw in Getting Started with the Skeleton is [here](https://github.com/quasarframeworkbrasil/skeleton-quasar/tree/examples/category). There are some repetitive manual work in the process, it may be interesting to create templates, snippets or use tools like [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) to make this faster.

It is possible that when you get to this point here there is a lot that has been left without a clear explanation that deserves much more attention. We recommend that the next reading is the [Concepts](../conceitos.md) page and immediately afterwards the whole topic that talks about the [Structure](../como-utilizar/) of the project.

It will be really cool to see how the buttons are managed, how we handle events or how it is possible to populate the side menu with the menu options that work with a recursive structure in the [Customization](../customizacao/) section.
