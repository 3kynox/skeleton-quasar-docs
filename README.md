# Installation

If you have SSH configured on Github you can make a clone using the command below where`my-project`is the name of the folder that will be created with the project.

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:quasarframeworkbrasil/skeleton.git my-project
```

If you are not sure about this or do not use the option via HTTPS where`my-project`is the name of the folder that will be created with the project.

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/quasarframeworkbrasil/skeleton.git my-project
```

The above commands will create the`my-project`folder, use whatever name you think is most appropriate. With the project on your workstation you can start coding like crazy!
